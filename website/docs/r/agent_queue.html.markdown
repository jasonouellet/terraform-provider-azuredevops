# azuredevops_agent_queue

Manages an agent queue within Azure DevOps. In the UI, this is equivalent to adding an
Organization defined pool to a project.

The created queue is not authorized for use by all pipelines in the project. However,
the `azuredevops_resource_authorization` resource can be used to grant authorization.

## Example Usage

### Creating a Queue from an organization-level pool

```hcl
resource "azuredevops_project" "example" {
  name = "Example Project"
}

data "azuredevops_agent_pool" "example" {
  name = "example-pool"
}

resource "azuredevops_agent_queue" "example" {
  project_id    = azuredevops_project.example.id
  agent_pool_id = data.azuredevops_agent_pool.example.id
}

# Grant access to queue to all pipelines in the project
resource "azuredevops_resource_authorization" "example" {
  project_id  = azuredevops_project.example.id
  resource_id = azuredevops_agent_queue.example.id
  type        = "queue"
  authorized  = true
}
```

### Creating a Queue at the project level (Organization-level permissions not required)

```hcl
data "azuredevops_project" "example" {
  name = "Example Project"
}

resource "azuredevops_agent_queue" "example" {
  name       = "example-queue"
  project_id = data.azuredevops_project.example.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `project_id` - (Required) The ID of the project in which to create the resource.

* `name` - (Optional) The name of the agent queue. Defaults to the ID of the agent pool. Conflicts with `agent_pool_id`.

---

* `agent_pool_id` - (Optional) The ID of the organization agent pool. Conflicts with `name`.

    ~> **NOTE:** One of `name` or `agent_pool_id` must be specified, but not both. 
        When `agent_pool_id` is specified, the agent queue name will be derived from the agent pool name.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the agent queue reference.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 10 minutes) Used when creating the Agent Queue.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minute) Used when retrieving the Agent Queue.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 10 minutes) Used when deleting the Agent Queue.

## Import

Azure DevOps Agent Pools can be imported using the project ID and agent queue ID, e.g.

```sh
terraform import azuredevops_agent_queue.example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/0
```
