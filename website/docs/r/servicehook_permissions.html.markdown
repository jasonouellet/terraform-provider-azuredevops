# azuredevops_servicehook_permissions

Manages permissions for Service Hook permissions.

## Permission levels

Permissions for service hooks within Azure DevOps can be applied on the Organizational level or, if the optional attribute `project_id` is specified, on Project level.
Those levels are reflected by specifying (or omitting) values for the argument `project_id`.

## Example Usage

  name               = "Example Project"
  work_item_template = "Agile"
  version_control    = "Git"
  visibility         = "private"
  description        = "Managed by Terraform"
}

data "azuredevops_group" "example-readers" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.example.id
  name       = "Readers"
}

resource "azuredevops_servicehook_permissions" "example-permissions" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.example.id
  principal  = data.azuredevops_group.example-readers.id
  permissions = {
    ViewSubscriptions   = "allow"
    EditSubscriptions   = "allow"
    DeleteSubscriptions = "allow"
    PublishEvents       = "allow"
