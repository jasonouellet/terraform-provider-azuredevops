# azuredevops_team

Manages a team within a project in a Azure DevOps organization.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azuredevops_project" "example" {
  name               = "Example Project"
  work_item_template = "Agile"
  version_control    = "Git"
  visibility         = "private"
  description        = "Managed by Terraform"
}

data "azuredevops_group" "example-project-contributors" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.example.id
  name       = "Contributors"
}

data "azuredevops_group" "example-project-readers" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.example.id
  name       = "Readers"
}

resource "azuredevops_team" "example" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.example.id
  name       = "Example Team"
  administrators = [
    data.azuredevops_group.example-project-contributors.descriptor
  ]
  members = [
    data.azuredevops_group.example-project-readers.descriptor
  ]
}
```
