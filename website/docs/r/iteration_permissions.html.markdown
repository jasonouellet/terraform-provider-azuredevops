# azuredevops_iteration_permissions

Manages permissions for an Iteration (Sprint)

~> **Note** Permissions can be assigned to group principals and not to single user principals.

## Permission levels

Permission for Iterations within Azure DevOps can be applied on two different levels.
Those levels are reflected by specifying (or omitting) values for the arguments `project_id` and `path`.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azuredevops_project" "example" {
  name               = "Example Project"
  work_item_template = "Agile"
  version_control    = "Git"
  visibility         = "private"
  description        = "Managed by Terraform"
}

data "azuredevops_group" "example-readers" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.example.id
  name       = "Readers"
}

resource "azuredevops_iteration_permissions" "example-root-permissions" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.example.id
  principal  = data.azuredevops_group.example-readers.id
  permissions = {
    CREATE_CHILDREN = "Deny"
    GENERIC_READ    = "NotSet"
    DELETE          = "Deny"
  }
}

resource "azuredevops_iteration_permissions" "example-iteration-permissions" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.example.id
  principal  = data.azuredevops_group.example-readers.id
  path       = "Iteration 1"
  permissions = {
    CREATE_CHILDREN = "Allow"
    GENERIC_READ    = "NotSet"
    DELETE          = "Allow"
  }
}
```
