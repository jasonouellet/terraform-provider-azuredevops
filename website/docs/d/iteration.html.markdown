# Data Source: azuredevops_iteration

Use this data source to access information about an existing Iteration (Sprint) within Azure DevOps.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azuredevops_project" "example" {
  name               = "Example Project"
  work_item_template = "Agile"
  version_control    = "Git"
  visibility         = "private"
  description        = "Managed by Terraform"
}

data "azuredevops_iteration" "example-root-iteration" {
  project_id     = azuredevops_project.example.id
  path           = "/"
  fetch_children = true
}

data "azuredevops_iteration" "example-child-iteration" {
  project_id     = azuredevops_project.example.id
  path           = "/Iteration 1"
  fetch_children = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `project_id` - (Required) The project ID.

---

* `path` - (Optional) The path to the Iteration, _Format_: URL relative; if omitted, or value `"/"` is used, the root Iteration will be returned

* `fetch_children` - (Optional) Read children nodes, _Depth_: 1, _Default_: `true`

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The id of the Iteration node

* `name` - The name of the Iteration node

* `has_children` - Indicator if a Iteration node has child nodes

* `children` - A list of `children` blocks as defined below, empty if `has_children == false`

---

A `children` block supports the following:

* `id` - The ID of the child Iteration node

* `name` - The name of the child Iteration node

* `project_id` - The project ID of the child Iteration node

* `path` - The complete path (in relative URL format) of the child Iteration

* `has_children` - Indicator if the child Iteration node has child nodes
